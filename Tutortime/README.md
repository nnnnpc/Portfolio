# Intruduction

This project aims to provide a web-based platform that would help students in any level to search for an appropriate tutor. This platform provides an easier way to connect with two of our targeting users, students and tutors. 

Thanks to my teammates hard-working, I was able to merge the Login（Authentication） page smoothly, as well as the UI of Discussion forum page. Since we were encountering some fatal errors with our database, I was asked to complete some functions of Discussion forum to deliver our project in time, and my teammate can focus on resolving problems.

If you want know what we did in detail, please find the file 'Projec_Propsoal.docx'.

### Acknowledge

Without my teammates' efforts and time, we cannot finish the project. Thanks to all of them.
